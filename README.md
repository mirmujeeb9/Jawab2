# Project Setup and Running Guide

## Prerequisites

- PHP >= 8.0
- Composer
- Laravel
- Node.js and npm
- Flutter

## Backend Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### 2. Navigate to the Backend Directory

Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and create a new `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file in a text editor and update the required fields with your environment-specific values. Ensure that all necessary environment variables (such as database connections, API keys, etc.) are set correctly for your environment.

### 4. Install Backend Dependencies

Install all required backend dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

### 5. Run Database Migrations

Run the Laravel database migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Run the Backend Server

- If running on the same machine as the code, use:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

- If running for an Android apk, specify the host IP:

```bash
php artisan serve --host={your_ip} --port=8000
```

Your backend server should now be running and accessible.

## Frontend Setup

### 1. Navigate to the Frontend Directory

In your terminal, move to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

### 2. Update Backend URL

- Navigate to `lib/utils/static_data.dart` in the frontend code.
- Update the `mainURL` variable to match the backend IP and port:

```dart
static const mainURL = 'http://{your_ip}:{port}/api/';
```

For Android emulators, the IP is commonly `10.0.2.2`, and the default port is `8000`.

### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using Flutter:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run the Frontend

- To run on an emulator or physical device:

```bash
flutter run
```

- To build an APK for Android:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

The APK can be found in the following directory:

```plaintext
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Backend not starting:** Ensure you have correctly set up the `.env` file and installed the required PHP dependencies.
- **Frontend not connecting:** Make sure the IP and port in `mainURL` match the running backend serverâ€™s IP and port.
- **CORS Issues:** If you run into CORS issues, ensure your backend allows cross-origin requests from the frontend.

This guide should help you set up and run both the backend and frontend components of the project. For more detailed information, refer to the documentation for Laravel and Flutter.
